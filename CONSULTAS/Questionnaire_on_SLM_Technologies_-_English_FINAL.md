<a name="_page3_x63.00_y46.04"></a>**Introduction to the questionnaire** 

**About the WOCAT documentation of SLM practices**  

**Welcome to WOCAT** 

WOCAT  provides  standardized,  user-driven,  open-access,  globally-used  tools  and  methods  for  the  documentation  and assessment of sustainable land management (SLM) practices. **SLM** in the context of WOCAT is defined as the sustainable use of land resources – including soils, water, vegetation, and animals. WOCAT focuses on efforts to prevent and reduce land degradation and restore degraded land through improved **land management technologies** and **approaches to implementing these**. All practices may be considered, whether they are indigenous, newly introduced through projects, or recent innovations by land users. All information documented through WOCAT questionnaires is made available in the Global SLM Database and can be used to spread SLM knowledge and improve decision-making for further implementation and dissemination of SLM practices. 

**Technology or Approach?**  

There are two separate questionnaires: one for Technologies and one for Approaches. Taken together, they provide the full picture  of  an  SLM  practice. Ideally,  you  would  first  fill  in  the  questionnaires on  SLM  Technologies  followed  by  the questionnaire on SLM Approaches. The difference between an SLM Technology and an SLM Approach is as follows: 

*An **SLM Technology** is a physical practice that controls land  An **SLM Approach** defines the ways and means used to implement degradation and enhances productivity and/ or other ecosystem ![](Aspose.Words.afb0f8c4-2033-43df-9e57-866bddd5a58b.003.png)![](Aspose.Words.afb0f8c4-2033-43df-9e57-866bddd5a58b.004.png) one or several SLM Technologies. It includes technical and services. A Technology consists of one or several measures, such  material support as well as the involvement and roles of different as agronomic, vegetative, structural, and management measures.  stakeholders. An Approach can refer to a project/ programme or to* Example:  *activities initiated by land users themselves.*** Example: [https://qcat.wocat.net/en/wocat/technologies/view/techn](https://qcat.wocat.net/en/wocat/technologies/view/technologies_3359/) [https://qcat.wocat.net/en/wocat/approaches/view/approac ](https://qcat.wocat.net/en/wocat/approaches/view/approaches_3173/)[ologies_3359/](https://qcat.wocat.net/en/wocat/technologies/view/technologies_3359/) [hes_3173/](https://qcat.wocat.net/en/wocat/approaches/view/approaches_3173/)

An  Approach  should  always  be  linked  to  one  or  several  Technologies.  Optional  thematic  modules  provide  in-depth information  on  specific  topics  (such  as  Climate  Change  Adaptation,  Watershed  and  Runoff,  and  Mapping  Land Degradation and Conservation). See [https://qcat.wocat.net ](https://qcat.wocat.net/)

**How to document and review WOCAT data** 

1) Familiarize  yourself  with  the  paper  questionnaire  (download  it  at [ https://www.wocat.net/en/global-slm-database/slm- practices-technologies-and-approaches)](https://www.wocat.net/en/global-slm-database/slm-practices-technologies-and-approaches). Go through the questions. Read the *instructions, explanations, definitions, and examples (in italics)*. Contact the WOCAT Secretariat if you have questions. 
1) Start filling in the questionnaire based on your knowledge and existing documents. Please write clearly and legibly. 
1) Identify land users and other key resource persons with in-depth knowledge of the SLM Technology/ Approach (ideally a team of specialists with different backgrounds and experience). 
1) Collect  data  in  the  field.  Gather  information  through  interviews  with  land  user(s)  and  key  resource  persons.  Take measurements and photos, and make technical drawings. 
1) Enter  the compiled  information  in  the  Global  SLM  Database.  Go  to [ https://qcat.wocat.net ](https://qcat.wocat.net/) and create  a  new  SLM Technology/ Approach data entry form. Type the data collected – section by section, and upload images and other digital files. 
1) The Global SLM Database will guide you on how to edit and submit your data for review, making sure it is complete, clear, and comprehensible. You can invite editors (registered WOCAT users) to help you.

4. **Declaration<a name="_page7_x63.00_y419.04"></a> on sustainability of the described Technology** 

*WOCAT questionnaires focus on the documentation and assessment of SLM practices. However, the questionnaires can also be used to describe a non-sustainable land management practice if you wish to compare this practice with specific SLM Technologies and/ or Approaches.*  

Does the Technology have adverse effects on land degradation, so that it cannot be declared a *sustainable* land management technology? 

- Yes        No 

Comments:  .......................................................................................................................................................................  ...........................................................................................................................................................................................  

5. **Reference<a name="_page7_x63.00_y575.04"></a> to Questionnaire(s) on SLM Approaches (documented using WOCAT)** 

*To correctly understand the implementation of the Technology, the associated SLM Approach must be described. Name the corresponding Approach and its compiler below, and make sure that a link is created in the database.* 

Name of SLM Approach:  Compiler: 

.................................................................................................   ...................................................................................  

2. **Description<a name="_page8_x63.00_y57.04"></a> of an SLM Technology** 

***An SLM Technology** is a practice applied in the field that controls land degradation and/ or enhances productivity. This questionnaire was designed to document a single SLM Technology and cannot be used to assess an entire farm.* 

*An SLM Technology may consist of one or several **SLM measures** (agronomic, vegetative, structural, and management measures); e.g. terraces combined with grass strips and contour ploughing.*** 

*The Technology you are documenting should be specific to a certain context. It should cover a homogeneous set of conditions, both natural (biophysical, i.e. altitudinal zone) and human (socio-economic, i.e. land tenure management).***  

***Site-specific information**: Information provided in this questionnaire should strictly refer to the sites that were assessed/ analysed during the documentation of the Technology (e.g. through interviews with land users, field surveys, etc.), even if the Technology is applied or applicable to a wider area.*  

<a name="_page8_x63.00_y218.04"></a>**2.1  Short description of the Technology**  

*Summarize the Technology in 1-2 sentences. Make sure this short description is precise and contains relevant keywords.  It is the lead text of this documentation and provides an important basis for searching the database.* 

.................................................................................................................................................................................  .................................................................................................................................................................................  

![ref1] **2.2 <a name="_page8_x109.00_y321.04"></a> Detailed description of the Technology![ref2]**

*The detailed description should provide a concise but comprehensive picture of the Technology to outsiders. It should therefore address key questions such as: (1) What are the main characteristics/ elements of the Technology (including technical specifications)? (2) Where is the Technology applied (natural and human environment)?  (3) What are the purposes/ functions of the Technology? (4) What major activities/ inputs are needed to establish/ maintain the Technology? (5) What are the benefits/ impacts of the Technology? (6) What do land users like/ dislike about the Technology? The description should ideally be 2,500-3,000 characters in length; the absolute maximum is 3,500 characters. Additional, more detailed descriptions may be uploaded to the database as separate documents. We suggest filling in the description at the beginning, and revising it once you have completed the questionnaire.*

***Natural and semi-natural forest management**: encompasses administrative, legal, technical, economic, social, and environmental aspects of the conservation and use of forests.* 

***Forest plantation management**: plantation forests comprise even-aged monocultures and are established primarily for wood and fibre production. They are usually intensively managed and have relatively high growth rates and productivity.* 

***Agroforestry**: integrates the use of woody perennials with agricultural crops and/ or animals for a variety of benefits and services, including better use of soil and water resources; multiple fuel, fodder, and food products; and habitat for associated species.*** 

***Windbreak**: or shelterbelt is a plantation usually made up of one or more rows of trees or shrubs planted in such a manner as to provide shelter from the wind and to protect soil from erosion. They are commonly planted around the edges of fields on farms.*** 

***Area closure (stop use, support restoration)**: enclosing and protecting an area of degraded land from human use and animal interference, to permit natural rehabilitation, enhanced by additional vegetative and structural conservation measures.*** 

***Rotational systems (crop rotation, fallows, shifting cultivation)**: The successive cultivation of different crops in a specified order on the same fields. letting it fallow for a period of time. Shifting cultivation is an agricultural system in which plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned and allowed to revert to their natural vegetation while the cultivator moves on to another plot.***   

***Pastoralism and grazing land management**: is the grazing of animals on natural or semi-natural grassland, grassland with trees, and/ or open woodlands. Animal owners may have a permanent residence while livestock is moved to distant grazing areas, according to the availability of resources.*** 

***Integrated crop–livestock management**: optimizes the uses of crop and livestock resources through interaction and the creation of synergies.*** 

***Improved ground/ vegetation cover**: any measures that aim to improve the ground cover, be it by dead material/ mulch or vegetation.***  

***Minimal soil disturbance** refers to no-tillage or low soil disturbance only in small strips and/ or shallow depth and direct seeding.***  

***Integrated soil fertility management** (IFSM) aims at managing soil by combining different methods of soil fertility amendment together with soil and water conservation. ISFM is based on three principles: maximizing the use of organic sources of fertilizer (e.g. manure and compost application, nitrogen-fixing green manure and cover crops); minimizing the loss of nutrients; and judiciously using inorganic fertilizer according to needs and economic availability.* 

***Cross-slope measures**: are constructed on sloping lands in the form of earth or soil bunds, stone lines, or vegetative strips, etc. for reducing runoff velocity and soil erosion.* 

***Improved plant varieties/ animal breeds**: refers to the development of new plant varieties or animal breeds that offer benefits such as improved production, resistance to pests and diseases, or drought tolerance, in response to changing environmental conditions and land users’ needs.* 

***Water harvesting**: is the collection and management of floodwater or rainwater runoff to increase water availability for domestic and agricultural use as well as ecosystem sustenance.*** 

***Irrigation management (incl. water supply, drainage)** aims to achieve higher water use efficiency through more efficient water collection and abstraction, water storage, distribution, and water application.*** 

***Water diversion and drainage**: is the natural or artificial diversion or removal of surface and sub-surface water from an area.*** 

***Surface water and adjacent area management (spring, river, lakes, sea)**: involves the protection of springs, rivers, riparian zones, lakes, and lakeshores from pollution, high water flows (floods), or over-abstraction of water, as well as protection measures against damage from waterbodies (e.g. river bank erosion, floods, tidal erosion).*** 

***Groundwater management**: involves securing the recharge of groundwater reserves and their protection from pollution, overexploitation/ overuse, and rising groundwater levels leading to salinization.*** 

***Wetland protection/ management**: managing wetland typically involves manipulating water levels and vegetation in the wetland, and providing an upland buffer.* 

***Waste management/ waste water management**: is a set of activities that include collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, prevention of waste production, and modification and reuse/ recycling of waste.* 

***Energy efficiency technologies**: reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services, e.g. for cooking and heating, reducing the demand for fuel (fossil, wood).*** 

***Beekeeping, aquaculture, poultry, rabbit farming, silkworm farming, etc.**: allow food production and agricultural products requiring small surfaces of the land.*   

***Home gardens** (also called backyard or kitchen gardens): are a traditional multifunctional farming system applied on a small area of land around the family home. They have the potential to supply most of the non-staple foods (including vegetables, fruits, herbs, animals, and fish). They also provide a space for recreation, leisure, and relaxation.*

***SLM measures – the constituents of a Technology*** 

*SLM measures fall into five categories: agronomic, vegetative, structural, management, and other. Measures are components of Technologies. Each Technology is made up of one or – very commonly – a combination of measures: For instance, terraces – a typical structural measure – are often combined with other measures, such as grass on the risers for stabilization and fodder (vegetative measure), or contour ploughing (agronomic measure).*

Specify the goal of the Technology with regard to land degradation: 

*Tick no more than two answers. If you tick “not applicable”, please tick no other answer.* 

- to prevent/ avoid land degradation 
- to reduce land degradation 
- to restore/ rehabilitate severely degraded land / reverse land degradation 
- to adapt to land degradation 
- not applicable

Comments/ remarks:  ..............................................................................................................................................  .................................................................................................................................................................................  ***Explanation of terms used above*** 

***Prevent (avoid)**: the use of good land management practices on land that may be prone to land degradation. They maintain natural resources and their environmental and productive functions.*** 

***Reduce**: interventions intended to reduce ongoing degradation and/ or halt further degradation. They start improving natural resources and their functions. Impacts tend to be noticeable in the short to medium term.* 

***Rehabilitate/ restore land / reverse degraded land**: required when the land is already degraded to such an extent that the original use is no longer possible, and land has become practically unproductive. Here, longer-term and more costly investments are needed to show any impact.*** 

***Adapt**: applied when rehabilitation/ restoration of the original state of the land is no longer possible or requires resources beyond the means of land users. This means the state of land degradation is “accepted”, but land management is adapted to suit the degradation (e.g. adapting to soil salinity by introducing salt-tolerant plants).*

*Notes on implementation, inputs, and costs:* 

- *It may be difficult to determine the costs of a Technology. Nevertheless, we ask you to give your best estimate!* 
- *Please distinguish between initial establishment/ initial investment (e.g. construction, initiation, animals) and maintenance/ recurrent annual activities.* 
- *All costs should be calculated based on market prices. If labour is provided by land users themselves, indicate the equivalent cost of hired labour. If inputs are provided/ produced by land users themselves, indicate the equivalent market price.* 
- *Exclude costs of awareness creation, planning, training, research, and financial/ material support (these will be addressed in the Approach questionnaire).* 
- *If the objective is to compare two situations, i.e. the situation after/ with SLM measures (e.g. conservation agriculture) and the situation before/ without SLM measures (e.g. conventional agriculture), fill in two questionnaires.* 
- *Preferably, activities, inputs, and costs should be calculated per area on which the Technology is applied. If you use a local area unit, indicate conversion factor between local unit and hectares. Include not only the area that is immediately covered by SLM measures (e.g. the area covered by stone walls, tree lines, ditches) but also the area that is affected/ protected by the SLM measures (e.g. the area between stone walls, tree lines, ditches).* 
- *Alternatively, if it is not possible to calculate activities, inputs, and costs per area, they may be calculated per unit (e.g. a dam, an animal watering point, an energy saving stove) or per length (e.g. 10 metres of stone line)* 

Specify how costs and inputs were calculated 

- per Technology area  à indicate size and area unit: ……………………… (e.g. 24 acres, 4.5 hectares) 

  If using a local area unit, indicate conversion factor: 1 hectare =…………… (e.g. 1 hectare = 2.47 acres) 

*Refer to area specified in 2.5. For conversions between local and metric units we recommend using an online unit converter, e.g.[` `*http://unitconverters.net/* ](http://unitconverters.net/)* 

***Technology area**: e.g. area of terraced cropland, area closed for natural regeneration, area used for rotational grazing, etc* 

- per Technology unit: à specify unit: …………………….. (e.g. watering point, energy saving stove, stone line) specify dimensions of unit (if relevant): ………….. (e.g. stone lines: 250 m, dam: 20,000 m3)
